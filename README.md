## Overview

DuckHive is an AI coding CLI built on top of [Gitlawb/openclaude](https://github.com/Gitlawb/openclaude). That OpenClaude codebase is the direct upstream base for this fork. OpenClaw is a separate harness project that influenced parts of the broader ecosystem, but DuckHive itself extends the OpenClaude line directly. On top of that base, DuckHive swaps the default model to **MiniMax M2.7**, adds **Agent Teams** for multi-agent orchestration, layers in **AI Council** for adversarial deliberation, and integrates full **MiniMax CLI (mmx)** support for image, speech, music, and video generation — all from a single `duckhive` command.

### Key Differentiators from OpenClaude

| OpenClaude ships | DuckHive adds |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Claude as default | **MiniMax M2.7** as default |
| Basic tool set | **24+ custom tools** including mmx, council, senate |
| Single-agent | **Sub-Agent spawning** with per-agent model routing |
| No deliberation layer | **AI Council** — 46 adversarial councilors |
| No MiniMax modalities | **Full mmx** — image, speech, music, video |
| No shell toggle | **Ctrl-X shell toggle** |
| No hierarchical context | **DUCK.md** context loading (gemini-cli style) |
| No project init | **init_tool** — auto-generates AGENTS.md + workspace setup |
| No session export | **/export** — zip sessions for sharing |
| No built-in council daemon | **Integrated Council daemon** — auto-starts on first run |
| Basic MCP | **dmcp** — enhanced MCP server management |
| Distribution | **npm global install** — one command setup |

## Features

### Experimental Bubble Tea TUI

DuckHive now includes an additive Go/Bubble Tea shell. Plain interactive `duckhive` auto-starts the Go TUI when `tui/duckhive-tui` is present, and `duckhive tui` remains available as an explicit launcher. Set `DUCKHIVE_NO_AUTO_TUI=1` if you want to stay in the legacy Ink REPL.

The TUI is only one surface of that work. The actual goal is to merge the useful parts of Codex, Gemini CLI, Kimi CLI, OpenClaw, duck-cli, MiniMax Agent CLI, and mercury-agent throughout the whole DuckHive harness: shared tools, orchestration, sessioning, model routing, permissions, media jobs, automation, and every major interaction surface.

The rule going forward is:

- land imported capabilities in shared harness layers first
- surface them in `duckhive`, the Go TUI, the legacy REPL, print/headless flows, and backend services second
- avoid TUI-only implementations for features that should exist across the product

Current TUI foundations:

- Welcome screen that highlights imported feature pillars
- Agent, Shell, Council, and Media composer modes
- Kimi-style `Ctrl-X` shell toggle inside the TUI
- Session rail for bridge state, checkpoints, context files, and imported capability status
- Transcript rail toggle and tracked TUI backlog files

Harness capability tracking currently lives in:

- `tui/TODO.md`
- `tui/KANBAN.md`
- `tui/FEATURE_MATRIX.md`

Validation for the Go shell:

```bash
cd tui
go test ./...
```

### Getting Started

**Option 1 — npm install:**
```bash
npm install -g github:Franzferdinan51/DuckHive
# after publishing to npm:
# npm install -g duckhive

# OR clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/Franzferdinan51/DuckHive.git
cd DuckHive && bun install && bun run build
```

**Option 2 — Direct run:**
```bash
./bin/duckhive
```

Interactive `duckhive` launches the Go TUI first. Use `DUCKHIVE_NO_AUTO_TUI=1 ./bin/duckhive` to stay in the legacy TypeScript REPL.

**After setup:**
```bash
# First-run: init_tool auto-analyzes your project and creates AGENTS.md
/init_tool action=setup

# Then just code
duckhive "Implement a REST API"
```

---

### Distribution

DuckHive is distributed as a `duckhive` launcher that boots the TypeScript agent core and, for interactive sessions, hands off to the checked-in Go TUI binary:

| Method | Command |
|--------|---------|  
| npm from GitHub | `npm i -g github:Franzferdinan51/DuckHive` |
| npm after publish | `npm i -g duckhive` |
| Homebrew | `brew install franzferdinan51/tap/duckhive` |
| Git clone | `git clone && bun install && bun run build` |

The TypeScript agent core (`dist/cli.mjs`) is built via `bun run build` and runs under the Go CLI harness. All integrated services (council daemon on port 3007, MCP servers) are started on-demand.

### /init — Project Setup

> **For non-interactive use (scripts, CI, --print mode): use `init_tool` below.**
> The built-in `/init` REPL command requires an interactive terminal.

**Interactive REPL mode:**
```bash
/init   # Launches the interactive setup wizard
```

**Non-interactive (scripts / CI / --print mode):**
```bash
/init_tool action=setup    # Auto-analyze + create AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md
/init_tool action=detect   # Preview what would be created
/init_tool action=config   # Configure ~/.duckhive/config.json
```

### /export — Session Packaging

Zip up a DuckHive session for sharing or archival. Includes context files, history, and config.

```bash
/export                        # Export current session
/export list                   # Show saved exports
/export import session.zip    # Restore a session
```

### Sub-Agent Spawning with Model Routing

Spawn specialized sub-agents with automatic model selection based on task type. Each sub-agent gets the optimal model from the router.

```bash
# Spawn a coding sub-agent (routes to GPT-4o or best available)
/subagent spawn coding "Implement a REST API"

# Spawn with explicit model
/subagent spawn --model qwen3.6-35b "Analyze this code"

# Route a task by complexity
/router route "build a Flutter app" complexity=7 vision=true
```

### Integrated Council Daemon

AI Council deliberation is auto-started on first run. No separate install — the daemon forks automatically and stays alive between runs.

```bash
/council "Should we use microservices?" mode=adversarial
/team spawn analysis "Research Redis caching"
/senate show DECREE-001
```

---

### MiniMax M2.7 — Default Model

DuckHive boots with **MiniMax M2.7** as the default model, shown right in the startup banner. MiniMax M2.7 is a powerful reasoning and coding model that handles complex agentic tasks efficiently. The Hybrid Orchestrator routes tasks intelligently:

- **Complexity 1–3**: Fast path, direct execution
- **Complexity 4–6**: Best model routing + optional council
- **Complexity 7–10**: Full deliberation with AI Council

---

### DuckHive mmx — All MiniMax Modalities

DuckHive mmx gives you the full MiniMax CLI stack directly from the harness. Generate images, synthesize speech, create music, and produce video without leaving the CLI.

```bash
# Generate images
duckhive mmx image "A cyberpunk cat"
duckhive mmx image "A serene mountain lake at dawn" --aspect 16:9

# Text-to-speech
duckhive mmx speech synthesize --text "Hello from DuckHive" --out hello.mp3
duckhive mmx speech synthesize --text "System online" --voice narrator --out alert.mp3

# Music generation
duckhive mmx music generate --prompt "Upbeat electronic, driving beat" --out track.mp3
duckhive mmx music generate --prompt "Sad piano ballad" --lyrics "Verse 1: Lost in the rain..." --out ballad.mp3

# Video generation
duckhive mmx video "A drone flying through redwood trees"
```

---

### Ctrl-X Shell Toggle

Drop from AI mode into a real shell and return seamlessly — no second terminal needed.

```bash
# Inside duckhive
duckhive> Ctrl-X   # → drops to shell
$ ls -la
$ exit            # → returns to duckhive AI mode
```

Inspired by Kimi CLI's shell mode, built into the harness for zero-friction context switching.

---

### DUCK.md Context Loading

DuckHive loads hierarchical context from `DUCK.md` files (gemini-cli style), merging project context into every session. Place a `DUCK.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# My Project Context

## Project
- Name: MyApp
- Stack: Bun + TypeScript + Hono

## Key Files
- src/index.ts — entry point
- src/routes/ — API routes

## Commands
- bun run dev — start dev server
- bun run test — run tests
```

DuckHive automatically finds and loads the nearest `DUCK.md` up the directory tree, prepending it to every prompt.

---

### Desktop Control

DuckHive has full macOS desktop automation via the `desktop_control` tool and `/desktop` command, powered by [desktop-control-lobster-edition-skill](https://github.com/Franzferdinan51/desktop-control-lobster-edition-skill). Mouse, keyboard, screenshot, OCR, window management, app launching, and AI vision — all from the CLI.

**Setup (one-time):**
```bash
pip3 install --break-system-packages -r ~/.openclaw/workspace/desktop-control-lobster-edition-skill/requirements.txt
```

**Screenshot, OCR, windows (safe — no approval needed):**

### BrowserOS MCP — Full Desktop Browser Automation

DuckHive integrates [BrowserOS](https://github.com/browseros-ai/BrowserOS) for full desktop browser automation via Chrome DevTools Protocol. BrowserOS MCP is pre-configured in `config/mcporter.json` and available to DuckHive's MCP tools.

**Requirements:** BrowserOS.app must be running. Start it with:
```bash
open -a BrowserOS
```

**Via DuckHive MCP tools (`/mcp`):**
```
/mcp list           — list available MCP servers and tools
/mcp call browseros.new_page url="https://github.com"
/mcp call browseros.take_snapshot
/mcp call browseros.get_page_content
```

**Via mcporter CLI (standalone):**
```bash
mcporter list                          — list servers
mcporter list browseros --schema       — show BrowserOS tool docs
mcporter call browseros.new_page url="https://example.com"
mcporter call browseros.screenshot     — capture current page
mcporter call browseros.take_snapshot   — interactive element tree
mcporter call browseros.click element=42
```

**Available BrowserOS tools (66 total):**
- Navigation: `new_page`, `navigate`, `get_url`, `get_page_content`
- Interaction: `click`, `type`, `key`, `hover`, `select`, `evaluate`
- Screenshot: `screenshot`, `take_snapshot`, `take_full_page_screenshot`
- Tabs: `new_tab`, `close_tab`, `list_tabs`, `switch_tab`
- Downloads: `download_start`, `download_list`, `download_cancel`
- Clipboard: `copy`, `paste`

**Configured at:** `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` and `config/mcporter.json`

---

### Agent Teams

Spawn multi-agent crews that work in parallel on complex tasks. DuckHive integrates Agent Teams for structured delegation.

```bash
# Inside duckhive
/council "Should we use microservices here?"       # 46 councilors debate
/team researcher "Research Redis caching"          # Spawn researcher agent
/senate "Proposal: switch to Bun runtime"         # 94 senators vote
/decree "DECREE-007: Use Bun for all new APIs"    # Issue binding law
/orchestrate "Build a REST API"                  # Route by complexity
```

**Governance pipeline**: Council debates → Senate passes decree → Teams execute per decree.

> **Integrated Council daemon** — On first `duckhive` run, the AI Council daemon starts automatically on port 3007 and stays alive between invocations. No separate install needed.

---

### /swarm — Code Swarming

Code swarming launches parallel sub-agents across 17 specialized domains to tackle complex tasks from multiple angles simultaneously.

```bash
/swarm "Build a REST API" --domain=coding --count=4
/swarm "Audit this security vulnerability" --domain=security
/swarm "Research new ML techniques" --domain=research
/swarm --list          # Show all 17 available domain agents
/swarm --list-domain   # List domain agent capabilities
/swarm --dry-run       # Preview what would spawn
```

**Domain agents include:** coding, code-review, security, debugging, architecture, testing, devops, research, analysis, docs, optimization, refactor, backend, frontend, mobile, infrastructure, data

### Swarm Voting — Multi-Agent Response Routing

When multiple agents respond, DuckHive routes the best response through three strategies:

```bash
/swarm vote           # Peer voting — agents score each other's work
/swarm merge          # Merge — combine complementary responses
/swarm pick-best      # Pick — score by completeness + correctness + code quality
```

**Strategies:**
- `vote()` — agents rate peers, highest score wins (LLM-based peer scoring)
- `merge()` — combine responses, deduplicate overlapping sections
- `pickBest()` — heuristic scoring: completeness (40%), correctness (30%), code quality (30%)

Integrates with existing `teammateMailbox.ts` — no new agent spawning mechanism needed.

---

### /acp — ACP Server for IDE Integration

Start the Agent Client Protocol server for IDE integration (Kimi CLI style).

```bash
/acp                    # Start ACP server
/acp status            # Check server status
/acp stop              # Stop server
```

---

### /spawn — Subagent Spawning

Spawn a subagent teammate to handle a task in parallel (Hermes Agent style).

```bash
/spawn "Implement a REST API"
/spawn "Analyze this code" --label=reviewer
```

---

### /introspect — DUCK.md Influence Analysis

Analyze how DUCK.md context files are influencing the current session (Gemini CLI style).

```bash
/introspect             # Analyze current session influence
/context load          # Reload context files
/context scan          # Scan for DUCK.md files in scope
```

---

### /prompt-suggest — Prompt Engineering Analysis

Analyze and suggest improvements to your prompts (Gemini CLI style).

```bash
/prompt-suggest "my complex prompt here"
```

---

### /instruct — DUCK.md Tuning Assistant

Helps you write and refine DUCK.md context files (Gemini CLI style).

```bash
/instruct "add a section about testing conventions"
```

---

### /changelog — Parse CHANGELOG from PR

Extract and format changelog entries from PR bodies or git commits.

```bash
/changelog                    # Parse current PR
/changelog 123               # Parse specific PR
/changelog --all              # Show all commits
/changelog --tag=v0.7.0      # Show commits since tag
```

Requires PR body format:
```markdown
<!-- CHANGELOG:START -->...<!-- CHANGELOG:END -->
```

---

### /pr-size — PR Size Classification

Classify the size of a pull request (XS→XL).

```bash
/pr-size                    # Current PR
/pr-size 123               # Specific PR
```

Output: `XS` (trivial), `S` (small), `M` (medium), `L` (large), `XL` (massive)

---

### Session Search — Full-Text Search Across Sessions

Search past sessions using FTS5 (SQLite full-text search).

```bash
# Via /memory or context tools
/memory search "authentication bug"
/session search "REST API implementation"
```

---

### Skill Workshop — Auto-Capture Complex Tasks

Automatically captures complex tasks as reusable skills for future sessions.

```bash
/skill "my new skill"        # Create from current task
/skill --capture            # Auto-capture mode
/skills                     # List all skills
```

---

### MCP Server Management

Manage Model Context Protocol servers with the `dmcp` CLI.

```bash
duckhive dmcp list          # List installed MCP servers
duckhive dmcp add <server>  # Add an MCP server
duckhive dmcp remove <name> # Remove an MCP server
duckhive dmcp health        # Check MCP server health
```

---

### Memory & Intelligence — 3-Layer Recall System

DuckHive layers three memory systems for progressively smarter recall:

```
Query → BM25 (keyword, fast) → EmbedRecall (semantic) → LESSONS (permanent failure moat)
```

**BM25 Keyword Search** (`src/memdir/bm25.ts`) — From-scratch BM25, no external deps:
- Inverted index over all session files, stored in `~/.duckhive/bm25-index.json`
- Tokenize: lowercase, strip punctuation, split on whitespace
- BM25 formula: k1=1.5, b=0.75
- `buildIndex()`, `search(query, limit?)`, `updateIndex()`, `clearIndex()`

**Embed Recall** (`src/memdir/embedRecall.ts`) — Semantic/conceptual search:
- Primary: LM Studio `/v1/embeddings` if `LM_STUDIO_URL` is set
- Fallback: TF-IDF cosine similarity (no external calls, runs locally)
- 82 stopwords filtered, IDF rebuilt on every index update
- `indexDocument()`, `search()`, `clearIndex()`, `indexSessionContent()`

**LESSONS.md** (`src/memdir/lessons.ts`) — Permanent failure moat:
- Append-only log of every provider failure, tool error, API limit, and infra mistake
- Never compacted, never deleted — the permanent record of what doesn't work
- `recordLesson()`, `getLessonsForTask(query)`, `recordProviderFailure()`, `recordToolError()`
- Auto-deduplication: 80% word overlap threshold prevents recording the same failure twice
- Pre-flight check: `getLessonsForTask()` called at session start before repeating past approaches
- Location: `<memdir>/LESSONS.md`, tags: `provider-failure`, `tool-error`, `api-limit`, `infra`, `code-pattern`, `permission`, `security`

### Task Planner — Structured Decomposition

DuckHive plans complex tasks before executing, with two planner strategies:

```bash
# Auto-selects based on task complexity
/plan "Build a REST API with auth"

# Force LLM planner for complex tasks
/plan --llm "Architect a microservices system"
```

**SimplePlanner** — Fast keyword heuristics, dependency ordering, per-step complexity scoring.

**LLMPlanner** — Full reasoning for complex tasks (complexity ≥7), JSON plan output, falls back to SimplePlanner on parse errors.

### Budget Tracker — Daily Spend Enforcement

Tracks spend per provider daily and auto-falls back when budgets are exhausted:

```bash
/budget                 # Show current spend and remaining
/budget set minimax 5.00  # Set $5/day limit on minimax
/budget reset          # Reset all spend counters
```

State: `~/.duckhive/budget-state.json` · Log: `~/.duckhive/budget-log.jsonl` · Fail-open (never blocks API calls).

### Provider Cache — 30s Response Cache

Cache LLM responses for 30 seconds to skip redundant API calls:

```bash
/cache                  # Show cache stats (hits, misses, size)
/cache clear           # Flush entire cache
```

Keyed by `model::baseUrl::SHA256(messages)`, LRU eviction at 1000 entries. TTL configurable via `PROVIDER_CACHE_TTL=30`.

### Custom Providers — OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints

Add any OpenAI-compatible API without code changes:

```bash
/provider add my-endpoint --base-url https://api.example.com --api-key sk-xxx --model chat
/provider list            # Show all custom providers
/provider remove my-endpoint
```

Config: `~/.duckhive/custom-providers.json` · Auto health-checks endpoints on add.

### Channel Adapters — Unified Messaging

DuckHive unifies messaging across channels through a shared interface — the agent loop doesn't know or care which channel it's talking to:

```bash
/channel list           # Show all registered adapters
/channel status telegram  # Check Telegram adapter health
/channel send telegram "Hello"  # Send via Telegram
```

Adapters: **TelegramAdapter** · **WebhookAdapter** (HTTP receiver) · **EmailAdapter** (IMAP/SMTP) · **ConsoleAdapter** (local TUI/REPL for debugging). All normalize to DuckHive's `Message` type.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** 1.1+ (for build)
- **Node.js** 20+ (runtime)
- **Git**

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Franzferdinan51/DuckHive.git
cd DuckHive
bun install
bun run build
```

### Run

```bash
./bin/duckhive
```

For convenience, add `bin/` to your PATH or symlink:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/duckhive" ~/.local/bin/duckhive
```

---

## Configuration

DuckHive inherits the OpenClaude configuration model, while also carrying some compatibility paths from the upstream fork history. Set up your environment:

```bash
# MiniMax API key (required for default model + mmx)
export MINIMAX_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Optional: other providers
export KIMI_API_KEY=sk-kimi-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export LMSTUDIO_URL=http://localhost:1234

# Optional: configure default model
export DUCK_CHAT_MODEL=MiniMax-M2.7
```

See `~/.openclaude/`, project `.openclaude/`, and `~/.duckhive/config.json` for the current configuration surfaces carried by this fork.

### Meta-Agent Configuration

Configure meta-agent models, features, and limits in `~/.duckhive/config.json`:

```bash
# Initialize default config
duckhive config init

# View current config
duckhive config show

# Find config file path
duckhive config path
```

**Config schema:**

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "enabled": true,              // enable/disable meta-agent orchestration
    "complexityThreshold": 4,      // complexity level that triggers meta-agent (1-10)
    "models": {
      "orchestrator": "auto",     // model for task routing (auto, minimax/MiniMax-M2.7, etc.)
      "fast": "auto",              // model for simple tasks (complexity 1-3)
      "standard": "auto",           // model for medium tasks (complexity 4-6)
      "complex": "auto",           // model for complex tasks (complexity 7-10)
      "android": "auto",           // model for Android control tasks
      "vision": "auto",            // model for vision/screenshot analysis
      "coding": "auto"             // model for code generation tasks
    },
    "features": {
      "councilEnabled": true,      // enable AI Council deliberation
      "fallbackEnabled": true,     // enable automatic model fallback
      "selfHealing": true,         // enable self-healing on failures
      "learning": true              // enable learning from feedback
    },
    "limits": {
      "maxConcurrent": 3,          // max parallel sub-agents
      "maxRetries": 3,             // max retry attempts per task
      "timeoutMs": 60000           // default task timeout in ms
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "default": "minimax",          // default provider (minimax, kimi, openai, lmstudio)
    "fallback": "openrouter"       // fallback provider
  }
}
```

**Model alias examples:**
- `"auto"` — use DuckHive's default routing
- `"minimax/MiniMax-M2.7"` — specific provider/model
- `"kimi/kimi-k2.5"` — Kimi vision model
- `"local/qwen3.5-9b"` — local via LM Studio
- `"free"` — OpenRouter free tier

---

## Usage

```bash
# Start interactive session
./bin/duckhive

# Single command
./bin/duckhive -- "Explain this codebase"

# With specific provider
./bin/duckhive -- --provider minimax --model MiniMax-M2.7

# Version
./bin/duckhive --version
```
