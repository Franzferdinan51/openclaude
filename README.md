## Overview

DuckHive is an AI coding CLI built on top of [Gitlawb/openclaude](https://github.com/Gitlawb/openclaude). That OpenClaude codebase is the direct upstream base for this fork. OpenClaw is a separate harness project that influenced parts of the broader ecosystem, but DuckHive itself extends the OpenClaude line directly. On top of that base, DuckHive swaps the default model to **MiniMax M2.7**, adds **Agent Teams** for multi-agent orchestration, layers in **AI Council** for adversarial deliberation, and integrates full **MiniMax CLI (mmx)** support for image, speech, music, and video generation — all from a single `duckhive` command.

### Key Differentiators from OpenClaude

| OpenClaude ships | DuckHive adds |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Claude as default | **MiniMax M2.7** as default |
| Basic tool set | **24+ custom tools** including mmx, council, senate |
| Single-agent | **Sub-Agent spawning** with per-agent model routing |
| No deliberation layer | **AI Council** — 46 adversarial councilors |
| No MiniMax modalities | **Full mmx** — image, speech, music, video |
| No shell toggle | **Ctrl-X shell toggle** |
| No hierarchical context | **DUCK.md** context loading (gemini-cli style) |
| No project init | **`/init` + `init_tool`** — interactive setup plus scriptable project bootstrap |
| No session export | **/export** — zip sessions for sharing |
| No built-in council daemon | **Hive Nation bridge** — DuckHive can connect to a Council runtime when one is available |
| Basic MCP | **dmcp** — enhanced MCP server management |
| Distribution | **npm global install** — one command setup |

## Features

### Experimental Bubble Tea TUI

DuckHive now includes an additive Go/Bubble Tea shell. On macOS/Linux, plain interactive `duckhive` auto-starts the Go TUI when `tui/duckhive-tui` is present. On Windows, DuckHive now stays on the classic REPL by default for the no-args startup path because the standalone TUI handoff is not reliable enough yet. The Windows launcher also ignores inherited TUI handoff flags for no-args startup, so stale `DUCKHIVE_AUTO_TUI` / `DUCKHIVE_TUI_DIRECT` state cannot paint a UI that never accepts typing. `duckhive tui` remains available as an explicit launcher. Set `DUCKHIVE_NO_AUTO_TUI=1` if you want to stay in the legacy Ink REPL everywhere, or `DUCKHIVE_TUI_WINDOWS_EXPERIMENT=1` if you want to opt back into the Windows auto-launch path. UI-surface preferences persist through DuckHive's resolved config home, so `/tui`, settings UI changes, and startup auto-launch now read/write one shared `config.json`.

The TUI is only one surface of that work. The actual goal is to merge the useful parts of Codex, Gemini CLI, Kimi CLI, OpenClaw, duck-cli, MiniMax Agent CLI, and mercury-agent throughout the whole DuckHive harness: shared tools, orchestration, sessioning, model routing, permissions, media jobs, automation, and every major interaction surface.

The rule going forward is:

- land imported capabilities in shared harness layers first
- surface them in `duckhive`, the Go TUI, the legacy REPL, print/headless flows, and backend services second
- avoid TUI-only implementations for features that should exist across the product

Current TUI foundations:

- Welcome screen that highlights imported feature pillars
- Agent, Shell, Council, and Media composer modes
- Kimi-style `Ctrl-X` shell toggle inside the TUI
- Codex-style `/goal` status surfaced in the command deck, rail, and bridge-backed command path
- Session rail for bridge state, checkpoints, context files, and imported capability status
- Transcript rail toggle and tracked TUI backlog files
- Quieter terminal-first styling with inspector/transcript rails kept opt-in

Harness capability tracking currently lives in:

- `tui/TODO.md`
- `tui/KANBAN.md`
- `tui/FEATURE_MATRIX.md`

Validation for the Go shell:

```bash
cd tui
go test ./...
```

### Getting Started

**Option 1 — npm install:**
```bash
npm install -g github:Franzferdinan51/DuckHive
# after publishing to npm:
# npm install -g duckhive

# OR clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/Franzferdinan51/DuckHive.git
cd DuckHive && bun install && bun run build
```

**Option 2 — Direct run:**
```bash
./bin/duckhive
```

Interactive `duckhive` follows the OpenClaude-style classic REPL as the safe default on Windows. The launcher disables early key capture on Windows, forces the classic REPL for no-args startup, and clears inherited TUI handoff state unless you explicitly run `duckhive tui` or opt into `DUCKHIVE_TUI_WINDOWS_EXPERIMENT=1`; that keeps stale environment variables from freezing input behind a started UI. The renderer now uses the OpenClaude-compatible readable stdin path by default, so the prompt owns keyboard input when launched through npm's `duckhive.ps1` shim. The renderer leaves Windows `process.stdin` as the default input owner when it is already a TTY, but if a PowerShell/npm shim detaches stdin while stdout is still interactive, DuckHive automatically falls back to `CONIN$` so the classic REPL can receive keystrokes; set `DUCKHIVE_DISABLE_CONIN_STDIN=1` only for stdin fallback diagnostics. The launcher-provided DuckHive provider preference is now honored by the runtime route resolver, so the default MiniMax path does not fall back into Anthropic setup screens before the chat prompt mounts. Explicit `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `--yolo` startup is treated as user consent and no longer blocks the REPL behind an extra pre-prompt selector. Startup/status UI copy now avoids mojibake-prone separators and upstream `claude`/`openclaude` command guidance in terminal-sensitive surfaces, so Windows logs and PowerShell renders stay DuckHive-branded and readable. Run `duckhive tui` to launch the Go TUI explicitly, set `DUCKHIVE_USE_DATA_STDIN=1` only for stdin diagnostics, or set `DUCKHIVE_WINDOWS_EARLY_INPUT_EXPERIMENT=1` only if you intentionally want the older early-input buffering path. Auxiliary Council startup is also opt-in via `DUCKHIVE_AUTO_START_COUNCIL=1`, so default CLI startup does not wait on a daemon before the REPL is interactive.

The prompt-adjacent UI now uses DuckHive branding in active terminal surfaces too: guest-pass tickets show `DH`, idle notifications say DuckHive is waiting for input, IDE onboarding references DuckHive changes, and transcript-sharing copy asks to improve DuckHive rather than upstream Claude Code.

**After setup:**
```bash
# First-run: use the interactive setup wizard
/init

# Then just code
duckhive "Implement a REST API"
```

**Windows source checkout:**
```powershell
.\install.ps1
duckhive --dangerously-skip-permissions
duckhive --yolo
```

`--yolo` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` are the same startup mode. Both
are applied before the full CLI imports so permission-bypass startup is visible
to early-loaded modules as well as the interactive REPL. The same aliases are
also honored by direct-connect URLs and `duckhive ssh`, so remote/bridged
sessions do not lose bypass intent when using the shorter `--yolo` spelling.

You can also use the packaged local launcher scripts from a source checkout:
```powershell
bun run start:local -- --dangerously-skip-permissions
bun run start:local -- --yolo
```

For source checkouts, the outer `bin/duckhive` launcher now defers provider
and model selection to DuckHive's real startup-profile bootstrap instead of
hardcoding `ChatGPT/OpenAI` defaults ahead of the CLI. That means first-run
startup falls back to MiniMax, while saved `/provider` profiles and startup
settings stay authoritative.

If `duckhive` is not recognized in PowerShell, the package is not installed on your `PATH` yet. From a source checkout, run `.\install.ps1`; it creates `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\DuckHive\bin\duckhive.cmd` and updates both your user PATH and the current PowerShell session. You can also use `.\bin\duckhive.cmd` directly, install globally with `npm i -g github:Franzferdinan51/DuckHive`, run `npm link`, or use the published `duckhive` package when available.

If `duckhive` is launched from a redirected or otherwise non-interactive terminal
without `-p/--print`, it exits instead of painting a dead REPL. Use
`duckhive -p "<prompt>"` for headless output, or run `duckhive runtime-doctor`
from the terminal where you plan to type into the REPL.

If the REPL renders but will not accept typing, run `duckhive runtime-doctor`
from the same terminal. It checks Windows stdin mode, TUI fallback, provider
routing, ClawHub skill hub, computer-use fallback, Telegram connector config,
the installed `duckhive` launcher on `PATH`, and harness command registration
without starting the chat UI. Add `--strict-interactive` when you want the
doctor to fail unless stdin and stdout are attached to a real terminal. From a
source checkout, `bun run doctor:runtime:strict` runs that same strict terminal
readiness check, and `bun run doctor:runtime:strict:json` emits the failing
strict report as JSON for logs or issue reports. On Windows, `duckhive runtime-doctor`
should report `OpenClaude-compatible readable stdin is active by default`.
The startup context loader also uses a Windows-safe filesystem-root stop
condition now, so `DUCK.md` / `AGENTS.md` parent-directory discovery cannot loop
forever on `C:\` before `/goal`, headless print mode, or the interactive prompt
can accept input.
DuckHive clears fragile stdin overrides at startup unless
`DUCKHIVE_ALLOW_FRAGILE_STDIN=1` is set, because alternate stdin paths are most
likely to produce a painted-but-dead prompt under PowerShell. Readable stdin
remains the supported Windows default, while `DUCKHIVE_USE_DATA_STDIN=1` is
available only as an explicit diagnostic override.

### Distribution

DuckHive is distributed as a `duckhive` launcher that boots the TypeScript agent core and, for interactive sessions, hands off to the checked-in Go TUI binary. DuckHive owns only the `duckhive` command; the `openclaude` command should remain installed from `@gitlawb/openclaude`.

| Method | Command |
|--------|---------|  
| npm from GitHub | `npm i -g github:Franzferdinan51/DuckHive` |
| npm after publish | `npm i -g duckhive` |
| Homebrew | `brew install franzferdinan51/tap/duckhive` |
| Git clone | `git clone && bun install && bun run build` |

The TypeScript agent core (`dist/cli.mjs`) is built via `bun run build` and runs under the Go CLI harness. DuckHive starts its own MCP/runtime surfaces on demand, but the Hive Nation Council runtime is still an external or separately launched service rather than an always-on auto-started daemon in this source checkout.

For this source checkout, the supported local Council runtime command is:

```bash
bun run council:serve
```

### WebUI: Hybrid Agent Console

DuckHive ships a dedicated WebUI for a Codex-style workbench with OpenClaw-style operational visibility. The WebUI is backed by a DuckHive-owned API instead of depending on an OpenClaw dashboard process.

```bash
# Terminal 1: DuckHive WebUI API
DUCKHIVE_WEBUI_API_PORT=3017 bun run webui:api

# Terminal 2: React WebUI
VITE_DUCKHIVE_API_BASE=http://localhost:3017 bun run webui:dev
```

The WebUI API exposes health, status, agents, tools, MCP servers, sessions, AgentRun inspection, and run controls. It also streams run lifecycle events over Server-Sent Events at `/api/events`.
The WebUI run controls use the same shared AgentRun actions as the CLI and Telegram bridge: pause, resume, stop, recover, and targeted approval of the first pending approval ID when one is present.

Useful endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` | DuckHive WebUI API health/version |
| `GET /api/status` | provider, Telegram, search-provider, desktop/Android, OpenClaw optional status resolved from the active DuckHive runtime/config home |
| `GET /api/runs?status=running&parentRunId=...` | AgentRun list and root run tree with validated optional filters |
| `GET /api/runs/:id/events?limit=50` | compact run event tail, clamped to 1-200 events |
| `POST /api/runs/:id/pause` | pause a run |
| `POST /api/runs/:id/resume` | resume a run |
| `POST /api/runs/:id/stop` | cancel a run |
| `POST /api/runs/:id/approve` | approve a pending run action |
| `POST /api/runs/:id/recover` | mark a run for recovery |

Optional OpenClaw visibility is configured with `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`; DuckHive still owns the provider/model/session/tool/channel policy and the `duckhive` command.

### DuckHive SDK

DuckHive exposes the OpenClaude SDKv2-compatible runtime at `duckhive/sdk`. The SDK entrypoint is intentionally separate from the CLI bundle and builds to `dist/sdk.mjs` so consumers can import session/query APIs without pulling in React, Ink, or TUI-only modules.

```ts
import { query } from 'duckhive/sdk'

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: 'Summarize this repository',
  options: { cwd: process.cwd() },
})) {
  console.log(message)
}
```

The SDK surface includes generated schemas/types, query/session helpers, permission helpers, transcript helpers, and SDK-specific errors. `bun run build` verifies that the SDK bundle has no React/Ink leakage.

### Agent Harness Platform

DuckHive now has an experimental shared AgentRun control plane. Local agent tasks and hybrid orchestration runs are mirrored into a durable run store with normalized lifecycle events:

```
queued → preparing → running → awaiting_approval → paused → recovering → completed|failed|cancelled
```

The split follows the same safety boundary used by modern agent harnesses: DuckHive core owns provider/model selection, auth, session and transcript mirroring, tool policy, permissions, budgets, and channel delivery. A harness only executes a prepared attempt and streams events back.

Public experimental harness import:

```ts
import {
  registerAgentHarness,
  resolveAgentHarness,
  type AgentHarness,
} from 'duckhive/harness'
```

Runtime selection:

```bash
DUCKHIVE_AGENT_RUNTIME=auto              # default: choose a matching harness
DUCKHIVE_AGENT_RUNTIME=builtin           # force DuckHive core execution
DUCKHIVE_AGENT_HARNESS_FALLBACK=builtin  # default fallback
DUCKHIVE_AGENT_HARNESS_FALLBACK=none     # fail if no harness supports the run
```

The AgentRun store persists under DuckHive's config home by default, or under `DUCKHIVE_AGENT_RUN_STORE_DIR` when set. Shared run-control operations now cover list/inspect/tail-style event access, pause, resume, stop/cancel, approval, and recovery so Telegram, TUI, SDK/headless, and future harness plugins can use one lifecycle instead of separate state paths. `duckhive/harness` is intentionally separate from `duckhive/sdk` and builds to `dist/harness.mjs`.

### Telegram Remote Control

Telegram can inspect and control AgentRuns when `DUCKHIVE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set. For safety, set `DUCKHIVE_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` to a comma-separated chat allowlist before using a bot in shared chats.

Telegram bot run-control commands:

```text
/agents
/runs
/run <id>
/tail <id>
/pause <id>
/resume <id>
/stop <id>
/approve <id> [approval-id]
/status
```

DuckHive's CLI surface for that same lifecycle is the consolidated `/run` command:

```bash
/run list
/run <id>
/run tail <id> [limit]
/run pause <id>
/run resume <id>
/run stop <id>
/run approve <id> [approval-id]
/run recover <id> [summary]
```

The same consolidated surface is available outside the REPL as
`duckhive run ...`, `duckhive runs ...`, or `duckhive agent-run ...`; these
commands share the same durable AgentRun store as `/run`, Telegram, WebUI,
`duckhive ps/logs/attach/...`, and `--bg`.

The terminal `/run` surface validates status filters against the real AgentRun lifecycle and clamps event tails to 200 rows, so mistyped statuses and unbounded tails do not silently hide runs or flood the CLI. Top-level terminal run controls are also wired into the same store for non-REPL use:

```bash
duckhive ps [status]          # List AgentRuns
duckhive logs <id> [limit]    # Show recent AgentRun events
duckhive attach <id>          # Inspect an AgentRun and show attach guidance
duckhive pause <id>           # Pause a run
duckhive resume <id>          # Resume a paused run
duckhive approve <id> [appr]  # Approve a pending run action
duckhive recover <id> [note]  # Mark a failed/stuck run for recovery
duckhive kill <id>            # Cancel an AgentRun
duckhive --bg "long task"     # Register a queued AgentRun for shared controls
```

The old upstream `--bg`/`--background` spawning path no longer silently no-ops in DuckHive. It now registers a queued AgentRun in the shared store so `ps`, `logs`, `attach`, `kill`, `/run`, Telegram, WebUI, and harness consumers can see and control the request through the same lifecycle. Provider-backed detached execution is still a separate executor layer; this change makes background requests durable and inspectable instead of failing before they reach the control plane.

Long Telegram responses are chunked, Markdown delivery falls back to plain text, `/approve` uses the same AgentRun approval path as the CLI/WebUI and can acknowledge one pending approval ID without clearing the rest, and `bun run doctor:runtime` reports the Agent Harness, Telegram, and computer-use readiness state.

### /init — Project Setup

> **For non-interactive use (scripts, CI, --print mode): use the lower-level `init_tool` interface below.**
> The built-in `/init` REPL command requires an interactive terminal.

**Interactive REPL mode:**
```bash
/init   # Launches the interactive setup wizard
```

**Non-interactive tool interface (scripts / CI / --print mode):**
```bash
init_tool action=setup    # Auto-analyze + create AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md
init_tool action=detect   # Preview what would be created
init_tool action=config   # Configure ~/.duckhive/config.json
```

### /export — Session Packaging

Zip up a DuckHive session for sharing or archival. Includes workspace context files plus DuckHive config-home metadata such as exported settings and recent history. Exports now follow the live `history.jsonl` prompt-history format, while imports restore that history back into DuckHive's config home instead of polluting the project workspace. Older archives with legacy `history.json` are still accepted and converted into the active `history.jsonl` store on import.

```bash
/export                        # Export current session
/export list                   # Show saved exports
/export import session.zip    # Restore a session
```

### /goal — Persisted Workflow Goals

Track multi-step tasks across sessions with persisted goals. Inspired by Codex `/goal` (r0.128.0). Goals survive restarts and can be resumed later.

```bash
/goal Build user authentication system              # Codex-style shorthand create
/goal create Build user authentication system    # Create a new goal
/goal list                                          # List all goals
/goal list all                                      # Disable the 10-goal preview limit
/goal list active                                   # Filter by status
/goal list failed                                   # Show failed goals
/goal status goal_abc123                            # Show goal details
/goal pause goal_abc123                            # Pause a goal
/goal resume goal_abc123                           # Resume paused goal
/goal complete goal_abc123                         # Mark as done
/goal fail goal_abc123                             # Mark as failed
/goal attach goal_abc123                           # Link the current session UUID
/goal step add goal_abc123 Implement login API     # Add a step
/goal clear goal_abc123                             # Delete a goal
```

The same goal manager is available outside the REPL as `duckhive goal ...` or
`duckhive g ...`, so goal status, creation, and recovery still work when you
are diagnosing terminal input or running from automation.

Goals persist in DuckHive's config home (default `~/.duckhive/config.json`) and survive across sessions. DuckHive now supports the simpler Codex-style shorthand `/goal <description>` in addition to `/goal create ...`, while still rejecting single-word unknown subcommands like typos instead of silently creating junk goals. `/goal list` keeps a 10-goal preview by default and now reports the visible count accurately, while `/goal list all` really shows the full persisted set; filtered lists such as `/goal list active` and `/goal list failed` report both the filtered subset count and the overall persisted goal total. Unknown list filters are rejected instead of silently falling back to the full list, and failed goals are reachable with `/goal list failed`. `/goal attach` records the real active DuckHive session id instead of a synthetic placeholder, and goal status output shows that attached session so resumed work can be traced back to the conversation that owns it. Active steps now follow the goal lifecycle too: pausing a goal pauses its current step, resuming reactivates it, completing the goal marks the current step completed and clears the current-step pointer, and failing the goal marks the current step failed before clearing it. Adding a new current step now completes the previous current step so one goal does not accumulate multiple active steps. Step creation is restricted to active goals, so paused or completed goals cannot accumulate new active steps. Goal output uses ASCII-safe status labels like `[active]`, `[paused]`, `[done]`, and `[failed]` so Windows terminals and log captures do not render broken emoji/mojibake. When multiple active goals exist, `/goal pause`, `/goal complete`, `/goal clear`, and `/goal attach` now return command-specific guidance telling you which explicit `goal-id` form to run. Goal-first sessions also stay discoverable in portable history/list-sessions surfaces now: when a session starts with `/goal <objective>`, DuckHive reuses the command arguments as the session title instead of collapsing the thread to a bare `/goal` label. Search-provider preferences use that same resolved config-home `config.json`, so CLI and WebUI status now read/write one shared settings surface.

### Sub-Agent Spawning with Model Routing

Spawn specialized sub-agents with automatic model selection based on task type. When you do not pass `--model`, each sub-agent now gets a routed model from DuckHive's multi-model router based on the agent type and task text.

```bash
# Spawn a coding sub-agent (routes to GPT-4o or best available)
/subagent spawn coding "Implement a REST API"

# Spawn with explicit model
/subagent spawn --model qwen3.6-35b "Analyze this code"

# Route a task by complexity
/router route "build a Flutter app" complexity=7 vision=true
/router list
/router compare "analyze this architecture" --complexity=5
```

`/router` is now a real slash command instead of only a lower-level tool surface. It accepts the documented `key=value` syntax as well as `--key=value` flags for `complexity`, `vision`, `functionCalling`, `preferSpeed`, `preferQuality`, and `maxCost`.

`/spawn` and its `/subagent` alias now accept the README forms directly: an optional leading `spawn`, an optional leading agent type like `coding`, `--label`, and `--model`. Those values are forwarded into the teammate spawner instead of being silently treated as task text.

Regular prompt submissions now do a smaller version of that vision routing too: if the current main-loop model lacks image support but the prompt includes image blocks, DuckHive applies a route-aware model override to a known vision-capable model on that active provider when one exists.

### AI Council Runtime

DuckHive’s `/council`, `/team`, `/senate`, and `/orchestrate` surfaces speak to the Hive Nation runtime on port `3007` by default. DuckHive now aligns with the merged Agent-Teams council API shape and can inspect the live council runtime when it is available, but the Council service itself is still a separately launched process in this checkout rather than an auto-started bundled daemon.

```bash
bun run council:serve

/council "Should we use microservices?" mode=deliberation
/council --status
/council --stop
/council --modes
/council --councilors
/team spawn analysis "Research Redis caching"
/senate show DECREE-001
```

`/council` now resolves its available modes from the live Hive Nation backend when one is running, with a local compatibility fallback when it is not. That keeps the CLI aligned with the merged Agent-Teams council server instead of freezing an older client-side mode list. DuckHive also exposes `/council --modes` for the live mode catalog and `/council --councilors` for the live councilor deck, so the command can inspect the upstream council runtime instead of only starting a deliberation blind. Council mode parsing accepts the upstream AI-Bot-Council-Concensus spelling by mapping `concensus` to `consensus`, and missing `--mode` values now fail before starting a deliberation. The bridge now accepts the checked-in Council server's raw `/api/councilors` array shape directly, the bundled source-checkout runtime now exposes the `/api/team*` and `/api/decree*` routes that DuckHive's `/team`, `/senate`, and `/decree` surfaces already use, and the runtime health contract now includes `services`, `uptime`, and memory stats so DuckHive's governance context no longer treats a live Council server as partially offline by default. When Hive Nation is offline, the governance wrappers now consistently point source checkouts at `bun run council:serve` and `DUCKHIVE_COUNCIL_URL` instead of only `/council` doing it.

### MiniMax M2.7 — Default Model

DuckHive boots with **MiniMax M2.7** as the default model, shown right in the startup banner. MiniMax M2.7 is a powerful reasoning and coding model that handles complex agentic tasks efficiently. The Hybrid Orchestrator routes tasks intelligently:

- **Complexity 1–3**: Fast path, direct execution
- **Complexity 4–6**: Best model routing + optional council
- **Complexity 7–10**: Full deliberation with AI Council

### DuckHive mmx — All MiniMax Modalities

DuckHive mmx gives you the full MiniMax CLI stack directly from the harness. Generate images, synthesize speech, create music, and produce video without leaving the CLI.

```bash
# Generate images
duckhive mmx image "A cyberpunk cat"
duckhive mmx image "A serene mountain lake at dawn" --aspect 16:9

# Text-to-speech
duckhive mmx speech synthesize --text "Hello from DuckHive" --out hello.mp3
duckhive mmx speech synthesize --text "System online" --voice narrator --out alert.mp3

# Music generation
duckhive mmx music generate --prompt "Upbeat electronic, driving beat" --out track.mp3
duckhive mmx music generate --prompt "Sad piano ballad" --lyrics "Verse 1: Lost in the rain..." --out ballad.mp3

# Video generation
duckhive mmx video "A drone flying through redwood trees"
```

---

### Ctrl-X Shell Toggle

Drop from AI mode into a real shell and return seamlessly — no second terminal needed.

```bash
# Inside duckhive
duckhive> Ctrl-X   # → drops to shell
$ ls -la
$ exit            # → returns to duckhive AI mode
```

Inspired by Kimi CLI's shell mode, built into the harness for zero-friction context switching.

---

### DUCK.md Context Loading

DuckHive loads hierarchical context from `DUCK.md` files (gemini-cli style), merging project context into every session. Place a `DUCK.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# My Project Context

## Project
- Name: MyApp
- Stack: Bun + TypeScript + Hono

## Key Files
- src/index.ts — entry point
- src/routes/ — API routes

## Commands
- bun run dev — start dev server
- bun run test — run tests
```

DuckHive automatically finds and loads the nearest `DUCK.md` up the directory tree, prepending it to every prompt.

---

### Desktop And Android Control

DuckHive ships the bundled `newest-desktop-control` MCP gateway in `skills/newest-desktop-control`. It consolidates cross-platform desktop automation, Android ADB control, and Codex Computer Use detection behind one MCP surface. The older `desktop_control` tool and `/desktop` command remain available for the legacy Python/OpenClaw workflow, but new agent integrations should prefer the MCP gateway because it exposes stable tool names and compatibility aliases. The `/desktop` help and command description use ASCII-safe terminal text so Windows shells and log captures do not render broken approval or action markers.

**Setup (one-time):**
```bash
python3 -m pip install pyautogui pillow
adb devices -l   # optional, for Android devices/emulators
```

**MCP config:**
```json
{
  "newest-desktop-control": {
    "command": "node",

Desktop mouse/keyboard/app actions may require Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions on macOS. Android actions require Developer Options plus USB debugging or an emulator. Codex Computer Use is still detected through supported Codex integration points including a local `packages/computer-use-bundle/computer-use` checkout and the standard Codex.app bundle path `/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/plugins/openai-bundled/plugins/computer-use`. Custom test bundles can use `DUCKHIVE_CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_PLUGIN_DIR` / `CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_PLUGIN_DIR`, or direct client overrides with `DUCKHIVE_CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_CLIENT` / `CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_CLIENT`; `/computer-use` and `newest-desktop-control` honor the same override names. Separate from that, DuckHive also has a CHICAGO_MCP-gated built-in `computer-use` runtime path in builds where that feature is compiled in; in those builds the `computer-use` MCP server name is reserved for DuckHive itself, so `/computer-use` becomes an inspection/status surface rather than a path that rewires the Codex plugin on top of it. Status guidance is state-aware: it now tells you whether the built-in runtime owns the slot, whether a stale project MCP entry exists, whether to reload MCP, whether a Codex plugin bundle is merely discoverable for inspection, or whether to fall back to the bundled `newest-desktop-control` gateway. `/computer-use disable` works on every platform so Windows/Linux users can remove stale project MCP entries even though native Codex computer-use is macOS-only. If the native Codex plugin is missing, use `newest-desktop-control` for desktop, Android, and `computer_use_*` compatibility aliases instead of being blocked on Codex.app. DuckHive does not patch or bypass proprietary Codex binaries.

The same inspection/control surface is available outside the REPL as
`duckhive computer-use ...`, `duckhive cu ...`, or `duckhive comput-use ...`.
That keeps Codex computer-use status and stale MCP cleanup reachable while
debugging terminal input, startup, or provider configuration.

The plugin marketplace details view now inspects local-source plugins before installation. When a marketplace entry points at a checked-out plugin directory, DuckHive shows discovered `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `output-styles/`, `hooks/hooks.json`, and `.mcp.json` components instead of a generic placeholder, so Codex-style plugin browsing is less guessy for local harness development.

### Agent Teams

Spawn multi-agent crews that work in parallel on complex tasks. DuckHive integrates Agent Teams for structured delegation.

```bash
# Inside duckhive
/council "Should we use microservices here?" mode=deliberation
/council --status                                  # Inspect the active session
/council --stop                                    # Stop the active session via Hive Nation
/team research "Research Redis caching"            # Shorthand template form
/team spawn analysis "Research Redis caching"      # Explicit spawn form
/senate "Proposal: switch to Bun runtime"         # 94 senators vote
/decree "DECREE-007: Use Bun for all new APIs"    # Issue binding law
/orchestrate "Build a REST API" --mode=deliberation
```

**Governance pipeline**: Council debates → Senate passes decree → Teams execute per decree.

`/orchestrate` now preserves quoted task text when you add flags like `--dry-run`, `--council`, `--mode=...`, or `--team=...`, so the orchestration router sees the same task text the user typed. The selected `--mode` value is now forwarded into the hybrid orchestrator instead of being parsed and then ignored, and when you omit `--mode` DuckHive prefers the live Hive backend default (`deliberation`) before falling back to older compatibility modes.

`/senate` now accepts the bare shorthand form shown above in addition to `/senate issue ...`, and `/decree` strips wrapper quotes from the decree title/content instead of persisting the quote characters as part of the law text.

> **Hive Nation runtime** — DuckHive’s governance commands target the Hive Nation / Council service on port 3007 by default, but that service is not auto-started by the current source checkout. Start the Council runtime separately or point DuckHive at a running service with `DUCKHIVE_COUNCIL_URL`.

### Continuous Self-Improvement

For this source checkout, the built-in local Hive Nation runtime command is `bun run council:serve`.

DuckHive now has two separate background improvement loops:

- repeated-topic detection after memory extraction can author new `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` entries when the same workflow keeps showing up
- a self-improvement review fork now inspects recent turns after extraction and can write actionable review notes under `~/.duckhive/self-improvement/reviews/` when it detects missing durable memory, reusable skill gaps, or unfinished harness friction worth fixing later

This is intentionally best-effort and asynchronous. It should not block the main REPL turn.

---

### /swarm — Code Swarming

Code swarming launches parallel sub-agents across DuckHive's current runtime routing buckets to tackle complex tasks from multiple angles simultaneously.

```bash
/swarm "Build a REST API" --domain=coding --count=4
/swarm "Audit this security vulnerability" --domain=security
/swarm "Research new ML techniques" --domain=research
/swarm --list          # Show all available swarm agents
/swarm --list-domain   # List domain agent capabilities
/swarm --dry-run       # Preview what would spawn
```

`/swarm` accepts the higher-level aliases shown above such as `coding`, `security`, `code-review`, `analysis`, `backend`, and `frontend`, but resolves them onto the current runtime routing buckets: `build`, `audit`, `research`, `data`, `mobile`, and `game`. Unsupported domains are rejected clearly instead of falling through into a runtime error. `--count` is now validated as an integer from 1 to 8, so bad values like `0`, `-1`, `1.5`, or `9` stop before any teammate spawn is attempted. The review phase reports quality gates as configured targets until agent output supplies evidence; it no longer claims test/security/performance/documentation checks passed without proof. Swarm terminal output uses ASCII-safe phase, result, and vote labels so Windows terminals and log captures do not render broken emoji/mojibake.

### Swarm Voting — Multi-Agent Response Routing

When multiple agents respond, DuckHive routes the best response through three strategies:

```bash
/swarm vote "response A" | "response B"           # Proxy peer tally
/swarm merge "response A" | "response B"          # Combine complementary responses
/swarm pick-best "response A" | "response B"      # Heuristic ranking
```

**Strategies:**
- `vote()` — use explicit mailbox ballots when teammates submit them; otherwise fall back to one proxy vote per agent for the strongest peer
- `merge()` — combine responses, deduplicate overlapping sections
- `pickBest()` — heuristic scoring: completeness (40%), correctness (30%), code quality (30%)

The `/swarm` slash command now exposes these modes directly for pasted candidate responses. The shared swarm voting helper no longer points at stub mailbox modules: it now reads the current collector inbox, resolves the latest response summary per agent, accepts structured or plain-text `swarm_vote` ballots when they exist, and only falls back to proxy voting when no explicit ballots were submitted.

---

### /acp — ACP Server for IDE Integration

Start the Agent Client Protocol server for IDE integration (Kimi CLI style).

```bash
/acp                    # Start ACP server
/acp status            # Check server status
/acp stop              # Stop server
```

`/acp status` and `/acp stop` now manage the in-process ACP listener instead of being README-only placeholders. ACP `tools/call` and `tools/call_batch` now execute real shell, file-read, file-write, directory-list, and search operations through DuckHive's ACP server. ACP `chat/message` also routes through DuckHive's SDK query path, and clients that negotiate the `tools` capability can use the local shell/filesystem/search tool family directly (`Bash`, `PowerShell`, `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `LSP`). Other tools still stay denied and should go through explicit ACP `tools/call`.

---

### /spawn — Subagent Spawning

Spawn a subagent teammate to handle a task in parallel (Hermes Agent style).

```bash
/spawn "Implement a REST API"
/spawn "Analyze this code" --label=reviewer
```

`--label` is now honored by the slash command itself and becomes the spawned teammate's display/name prefix instead of being ignored by the UI wrapper.

---

### /introspect — DUCK.md Influence Analysis

Analyze how DUCK.md context files are influencing the current session (Gemini CLI style).

```bash
/introspect             # Analyze current session influence
/context load          # Reload context files
/context scan          # Scan for DUCK.md files in scope
```

When `DUCKHIVE_CONTEXT_COLLAPSE=1` or the compiled `CONTEXT_COLLAPSE` gate is
enabled, `/context` now remains safe to run: the context-collapse projection
helper is a real identity projection for the current direct-collapse mode, and
the collapse service notifies status subscribers when enablement or collapse
stats change.

---

### /prompt-suggest — Prompt Engineering Analysis

Analyze and suggest improvements to your prompts (Gemini CLI style).

```bash
/prompt-suggest "my complex prompt here"
```

---

### /instruct — DUCK.md Tuning Assistant

Helps you write and refine DUCK.md context files (Gemini CLI style).

```bash
/instruct "add a section about testing conventions"
```

---

### /changelog — Parse CHANGELOG from PR

Extract and format changelog entries from PR bodies or git commits.

```bash
/changelog                    # Parse current PR
/changelog 123               # Parse specific PR
/changelog --all              # Show all commits
/changelog --tag=v0.7.0      # Show commits since tag
```

Requires PR body format:
```markdown
<!-- CHANGELOG:START -->...<!-- CHANGELOG:END -->
```

---

### /pr-size — PR Size Classification

Classify the size of a pull request (XS→XL).

```bash
/pr-size                    # Current PR
/pr-size 123               # Specific PR
```

Output: `XS` (trivial), `S` (small), `M` (medium), `L` (large), `XL` (massive)

---

### Session Search — Literal + Keyword Search Across Sessions

Search past sessions by scanning persisted session message logs. The tool supports both longer keyword queries and short literal strings such as `UI`, `v2`, or punctuation-heavy searches.

```bash
# Via /memory or context tools
/memory search "authentication bug"
/session search "REST API implementation"
```

---

### Skill Workshop — Local Skills + ClawHub Registry

Create and manage reusable skill scaffolds for future sessions through DuckHive's shared skills directory, and connect to the OpenClaw ClawHub skill registry for search, inspection, and installation.

```bash
/skill "my new skill"        # Create a reusable skill scaffold
/skill search "calendar"     # Search ClawHub
/skill inspect calendar      # Inspect a ClawHub skill
/skill install calendar      # Install a ClawHub skill into DuckHive's skills dir
/skill capture               # Scan repeated memory topics and author matching skills
/skill read my-new-skill     # Inspect a saved skill
/skill delete my-old-skill   # Delete a saved skill
/skills                      # Open the skills manager UI
/curate status               # Hermes-style skill library grading
/curate run                  # Write a curation report and identify archive candidates
```

ClawHub registry notes:
- DuckHive searches ClawHub directly through its public skill APIs and requests ClawHub's non-suspicious result filter by default.
- `/skill inspect <slug>` surfaces ClawHub moderation verdicts, summaries, and reason codes when the registry provides them.
- `/skill install <slug>` refuses registry entries marked malware-blocked or `malicious` before downloading the archive.
- `/skill install <slug>` also validates the downloaded archive contains a root `SKILL.md`; invalid archives are removed instead of leaving an unloadable skill directory behind.
- Installed ClawHub skills are written under DuckHive's resolved `skills/` directory and get local provenance metadata at `.clawhub/origin.json`.
- Override the registry base with `DUCKHIVE_CLAWHUB_REGISTRY` or `CLAWHUB_REGISTRY` if you need a different ClawHub-compatible endpoint.
- `/curate` output uses ASCII-safe grades like `[A]` and plain separators so skill-library reports stay readable in Windows shells and log captures.

---

### MCP Server Management

Manage Model Context Protocol servers with the `dmcp` CLI.

```bash
duckhive dmcp list          # List installed MCP servers
duckhive dmcp add <server>  # Add an MCP server
duckhive dmcp remove <name> # Remove an MCP server
duckhive dmcp health        # Check MCP server health
```

---

### Memory & Intelligence — 3-Layer Recall System

DuckHive layers three memory systems for progressively smarter recall:

```
Query → BM25 (keyword, fast) → EmbedRecall (semantic) → LESSONS (permanent failure moat)
```

**BM25 Keyword Search** (`src/memdir/bm25.ts`) — From-scratch BM25, no external deps:
- Inverted index over shared DuckHive memory/config-home sources, stored in the resolved config home as `bm25-index.json`
- Tokenize: lowercase, strip punctuation, split on whitespace
- BM25 formula: k1=1.5, b=0.75
- `buildIndex()`, `search(query, limit?)`, `updateIndex()`, `clearIndex()`

**Embed Recall** (`src/memdir/embedRecall.ts`) — Semantic/conceptual search:
- Primary: LM Studio `/v1/embeddings` if `LM_STUDIO_URL` is set
- Fallback: TF-IDF cosine similarity (no external calls, runs locally)
- 82 stopwords filtered, IDF rebuilt on every index update
- Index and session bootstrap both use DuckHive's resolved config-home paths
- `indexDocument()`, `search()`, `clearIndex()`, `indexSessionContent()`

**FTS5 Search Layer** (`src/memdir/fts5.ts`) — SQLite-backed full-text indexing:
- Database and session roots now use DuckHive's resolved config-home and shared memory-base paths instead of separate hardcoded home directories
- `initFts5()`, `searchMemoriesFts5()`, `searchSessionsFts5()`, `getFts5Stats()`

**LESSONS.md** (`src/memdir/lessons.ts`) — Permanent failure moat:
- Append-only log of every provider failure, tool error, API limit, and infra mistake
- Never compacted, never deleted — the permanent record of what doesn't work
- `recordLesson()`, `getLessonsForTask(query)`, `recordProviderFailure()`, `recordToolError()`
- Auto-deduplication: 80% word overlap threshold prevents recording the same failure twice
- Pre-flight check: `getLessonsForTask()` called at session start before repeating past approaches
- Location: `<memdir>/LESSONS.md`, tags: `provider-failure`, `tool-error`, `api-limit`, `infra`, `code-pattern`, `permission`, `security`

### Task Planner — Structured Decomposition

DuckHive plans complex tasks before executing, with two planner strategies:

```bash
# Auto-selects based on task complexity
/plan "Build a REST API with auth"

# Force LLM planner for complex tasks
/plan --llm "Architect a microservices system"
```

**SimplePlanner** — Fast keyword heuristics, dependency ordering, per-step complexity scoring.

**LLMPlanner** — Full reasoning for complex tasks (complexity ≥7), JSON plan output, falls back to SimplePlanner on parse errors.

### Budget Tracker — Daily Spend Enforcement

Tracks spend per provider daily and auto-falls back when budgets are exhausted:

```bash
/budget                 # Show current spend and remaining
/budget set minimax 5.00  # Set $5/day limit on minimax
/budget set global 20.00  # Set the global daily budget cap
/budget reset          # Reset all spend counters
```

State: `~/.duckhive/budget-state.json` · Log: `~/.duckhive/budget-log.jsonl` · Fail-open (never blocks API calls).

### Provider Cache — 30s Response Cache

Cache LLM responses for 30 seconds to skip redundant API calls:

```bash
/cache                 # Show provider-cache stats (entries, hits, misses, TTL)
/cache clear           # Flush the provider response cache and reset session cache metrics
/cache-stats           # Show per-request cache history for the current session
```

Keyed by `model::baseUrl::SHA256(messages)`, LRU eviction at 1000 entries. TTL configurable via `PROVIDER_CACHE_TTL=30`. `/cache` now wraps the actual shared provider response cache, while `/cache-stats` remains the detailed per-request observability surface.

### Custom Providers — OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints

Add any OpenAI-compatible API without code changes through the interactive provider manager:

```bash
/provider                 # Open the provider manager UI
```

Config: `~/.duckhive/custom-providers.json` · Auto health-checks endpoints on add.

The current slash command opens the manager used to add, edit, delete, and activate provider profiles. Inline `/provider add|list|remove` subcommands are not currently implemented in the CLI.

First-class OpenAI-compatible presets are available through `/provider` and `--provider`, including OpenRouter and NVIDIA NIM:

```bash
duckhive --provider openrouter --model openrouter/auto
duckhive --provider nvidia-nim --model nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct
```

Use `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for OpenRouter and `NVIDIA_API_KEY` for NVIDIA NIM. DuckHive maps them onto the OpenAI-compatible runtime for the active session without requiring you to overwrite `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### Channel Adapters — Unified Messaging

DuckHive unifies messaging across channels through a shared interface — the agent loop doesn't know or care which channel it's talking to:

```bash
/channel list           # Show adapter readiness/config snapshot
/channel status         # Show all adapter readiness/config
/channel status telegram  # Check Telegram adapter health
/channel status webhook   # Check Webhook adapter config
/channel status email     # Check Email adapter config
/channel status console   # Check Console adapter availability
/channel send telegram "Hello"  # Send via Telegram
/channel send webhook "Hello"   # POST via configured outbound webhook
/channel send email "Hello"     # Send via configured SMTP/default recipient
/channel send console "Hello"   # Emit through the local console adapter
/channel connect telegram --token <TOKEN>
/channel connect webhook
/channel connect email
/channel disconnect telegram
/channel disconnect webhook
/channel disconnect email
```

Adapters: **TelegramAdapter** · **WebhookAdapter** (HTTP receiver) · **EmailAdapter** (IMAP/SMTP) · **ConsoleAdapter** (local TUI/REPL for debugging). All normalize to DuckHive's `Message` type. The `/channel` command now exposes real status snapshots for Telegram, Webhook, Email, and Console plus concrete Telegram connect/send, runtime Webhook connect/disconnect/send, runtime Email connect/disconnect/send, and Console send flows. Webhook status now reports inbound receive readiness, outbound send readiness, and current runtime connection state separately, and email status does the same for IMAP vs SMTP/default-recipient readiness plus live runtime state, so partially configured or currently disconnected adapters are shown accurately instead of looking fully ready. The ConsoleAdapter prompt, banner, help, status, and agent labels use ASCII-safe terminal text for Windows shells and log captures; `/connect` and `/channel` Telegram setup/status output now follows the same ASCII-safe rule.

Telegram supports `DUCKHIVE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`. `/connect` is the Telegram credential setup surface; webhook, email, and console setup/status/send flows live under `/channel`. If a user types `/connect webhook`, `/connect email`, or `/connect console`, DuckHive now points them at the exact `/channel` command instead of treating the connector name as a malformed bot token. `/connect status`, `/channel status`, `bun run doctor:runtime`, and the WebUI `/api/status` payload now reflect env-backed Telegram configuration as well as secure-storage state, including whether config came from storage or the current process environment and whether a chat ID is available. `DUCKHIVE_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` acts as both an inbound allowlist and, when `allowedChatId` is not passed directly, the default outbound reply target using the first chat ID in the list; malformed allowlists fail closed and `doctor:runtime` reports them as not ready instead of accepting every chat. `/connect` setup and success output now call out that allowlist explicitly, and channel labels use ASCII-safe `telegram:<bot-id>...` text for Windows terminals and copied logs. Env-backed status no longer inherits stale stored chat or connection-timestamp metadata from a different bot token, and `/connect disconnect` now clears both supported runtime token env vars inside the running DuckHive process. Tokens and registered chat IDs now restore correctly from secure storage across fresh starts. The long-polling path is hardened to keep polling after quiet `getUpdates` responses, bound Bot API calls with a timeout, and preserve later valid updates when earlier updates in a batch are filtered.

The same connector surfaces are available outside the REPL as `duckhive channel ...`, `duckhive connect ...`, and `duckhive telegram ...`. These paths are provider-free startup commands, so Telegram/channel setup and status stay reachable while debugging a frozen chat prompt or missing provider credentials.

### Custom Tools

DuckHive adds 40+ custom tools on top of the OpenClaude base:

| Tool | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **HiveCouncilTool** | `/council` | 46 AI councilors debate decisions |
| **HiveSenateTool** | `/senate` | 94 senators pass binding decrees |
| **HiveTeamTool** | `/team` | Spawn specialized multi-agent crews |
| **HiveDecreeTool** | `/decree` | Issue and enforce binding laws |
| **HiveOrchestrateTool** | `/orchestrate` | Smart complexity-based routing with parallel agent execution |
| **HiveSwarmTool** | `/swarm` | Code swarming — 17 domain agents in parallel |
| **SwarmVotingTool** | `/swarm vote\|merge\|pick-best` | Multi-agent response routing |
| **ConnectTool** | `/connect` | Connect Telegram bots and route other adapter setup to `/channel` |
| **MultiModelRouterTool** | `/router` | Route across 9+ providers |
| **ShadowGitTool** | `/shadow` | Git snapshots before changes (Gemini CLI style) |
| **CheckpointTool** | `/checkpoint` | Save and restore long AI sessions |
| **ContextTool** | `/context` | Hierarchical DUCK.md loading |
| **TaskPlannerTool** | `/plan` | Structured task decomposition (heuristic or LLM) |
| **AndroidTool** | `/android` | Full Android control via ADB |
| **VisionTool** | `/vision` | Phone screenshot + AI analysis |
| **MemoryTool** | `/memory` | Memory editor and recall surface |
| **LessonsTool** | — | Internal `LESSONS.md` failure moat used by memory/custodian flows |
| **BM25Tool** | — | Internal keyword index/search layer |
| **EmbedRecallTool** | — | Internal semantic recall layer |
| **KAIROSTool** | — | Internal proactive heartbeat/runtime surface |
| **MeshTool** | — | Internal agent mesh/networking surface |
| **SkillTool** | — | Internal runtime skill-generation primitive |

`/shadow` is now a real slash command wrapper around DuckHive's shadow Git safety net. It supports `/shadow checkpoint <message>`, `/shadow list`, and `/shadow restore <checkpoint-id> [--file <path>]` so the documented Gemini-style snapshot workflow is reachable from the CLI instead of only through the lower-level tool surface. `/checkpoint` save/list/load/delete output uses ASCII-safe status and separator text so checkpoint workflows stay readable in Windows shells and plain log captures.
`/duckcustodian` keeps the OpenClaw/Crestodian-style diagnostics and rescue path available from the terminal. Approval prompts, rescue-mode health checks, and setup findings now use ASCII-safe status text so they remain readable when normal CLI output is being copied through Windows shells, logs, or Telegram.

`/android` and `/vision` are now real slash commands too. `/android` exposes the documented ADB control flow (`devices`, `screenshot`, `battery`, `tap`, `swipe`, `text`, `shell`), and `/vision` exposes `phone_screenshot`, `analyze`, and `phone_tap` directly from the CLI instead of relying on unrelated mobile-app aliases or tool-only entrypoints.

`/memory`, `/skill`, and `/skills` are the actual user-facing memory/skill commands today. `/skill` now provides a lightweight workshop surface for scaffold/list/read/delete workflows against DuckHive's shared `skills/` directory, while `/skills` still opens the richer interactive manager UI. The lessons, BM25, embed recall, KAIROS, mesh, and runtime skill-generation entries above are implemented subsystems or tool primitives, but they are not currently registered as standalone slash commands in the DuckHive CLI.
| **SkillWorkshopTool** | `/skill` | Scaffold local skills, search/inspect/install ClawHub skills, and block malicious registry installs |
| **SkillManageTool** | `/skills` | Interactive skill manager UI |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** 1.3+ (for build/test)
- **Node.js** 22+ (runtime)
- **Git**

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Franzferdinan51/DuckHive.git
cd DuckHive
bun install
bun run build
```

### Run

```bash
./bin/duckhive
```

For convenience, add `bin/` to your PATH or symlink:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/bin/duckhive" ~/.local/bin/duckhive
```

---

## Configuration

DuckHive inherits the OpenClaude configuration model, while also carrying some compatibility paths from the upstream fork history. Set up your environment:

```bash
# MiniMax auth for the default model + mmx
export MINIMAX_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Optional alias if you already use the mmx ecosystem naming
export MMX_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Or sign in once with the MiniMax CLI and DuckHive will reuse ~/.mmx/config.json
# plus ~/.mmx/credentials.json OAuth access tokens, refreshing them with
# `mmx auth refresh` on demand during MiniMax requests when needed.
# mmx auth login --api-key sk-your-key-here

# Optional: other providers
export KIMI_API_KEY=sk-kimi-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export LMSTUDIO_URL=http://localhost:1234

# Optional: configure default model
export DUCK_CHAT_MODEL=MiniMax-M2.7
```

See `~/.openclaude/`, project `.openclaude/`, and `~/.duckhive/config.json` for the current configuration surfaces carried by this fork.

### Meta-Agent Configuration

Configure meta-agent models, features, and limits in `~/.duckhive/config.json`:

```bash
# Initialize default config
duckhive config init

# View current config
duckhive config show

# Find config file path
duckhive config path
```

**Config schema:**

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "enabled": true,              // enable/disable meta-agent orchestration
    "complexityThreshold": 4,      // complexity level that triggers meta-agent (1-10)
    "models": {
      "orchestrator": "auto",     // model for task routing (auto, minimax/MiniMax-M2.7, etc.)
      "fast": "auto",              // model for simple tasks (complexity 1-3)
      "standard": "auto",           // model for medium tasks (complexity 4-6)
      "complex": "auto",           // model for complex tasks (complexity 7-10)
      "android": "auto",           // model for Android control tasks
      "vision": "auto",            // model for vision/screenshot analysis
      "coding": "auto"             // model for code generation tasks
    },
    "features": {
      "councilEnabled": true,      // enable AI Council deliberation
      "fallbackEnabled": true,     // enable automatic model fallback
      "selfHealing": true,         // enable self-healing on failures
      "learning": true              // enable learning from feedback
    },
    "limits": {
      "maxConcurrent": 3,          // max parallel sub-agents
      "maxRetries": 3,             // max retry attempts per task
      "timeoutMs": 60000           // default task timeout in ms
    }
  },
  "providers": {
    "default": "minimax",          // default provider (minimax, kimi, openai, lmstudio)
    "fallback": "openrouter"       // fallback provider
  }
}
```

**Model alias examples:**
- `"auto"` — use DuckHive's default routing
- `"minimax/MiniMax-M2.7"` — specific provider/model
- `"kimi/kimi-k2.5"` — Kimi vision model
- `"local/qwen3.5-9b"` — local via LM Studio
- `"free"` — OpenRouter free tier

---

## Usage

```bash
# Start interactive session
./bin/duckhive

# Single command
./bin/duckhive -- "Explain this codebase"

# With specific provider
./bin/duckhive -- --provider minimax --model MiniMax-M2.7

# Version
./bin/duckhive --version

# Command ownership check
duckhive --version      # 0.11.0 (DuckHive)
openclaude --version    # upstream OpenClaude, if installed separately
```

## Verification

Current shipping/runtime gates:

```bash
bun test
bun run build
bun run verify:privacy
bun run smoke
bun run doctor:runtime
bun run doctor:runtime:strict
bun run doctor:runtime:strict:json
cd tui && go test ./...
```

`bun run doctor:runtime` reports the CLI input mode, terminal stdio attachment, terminal TUI launch path, computer-use fallback readiness, ClawHub skill-hub registry, and the terminal-first harness command registry. Use `bun run doctor:runtime:strict` in the terminal where you plan to type into DuckHive when you need a failing exit code for redirected or non-interactive stdin/stdout, or `bun run doctor:runtime:strict:json` when you need that failure in machine-readable form. The command registry check verifies that the core `/goal`, `/run`, `/computer-use`, `/channel`, `/connect`, `/skill`, `/spawn`, `/orchestrate`, `/team`, `/council`, `/senate`, `/decree`, `/swarm`, `/tui`, and `/doctor` surfaces are registered together instead of only appearing in documentation; it also checks high-value aliases like `/g`, `/subagent`, and `/cu` so the Codex/Hermes/computer-use shortcut paths stay wired. The skill-hub check reports the active ClawHub registry from `DUCKHIVE_CLAWHUB_REGISTRY`, `CLAWHUB_REGISTRY`, or the default `https://clawhub.ai`, and confirms that `/skill search`, `/skill inspect`, and `/skill install` are available. On Windows the launcher keeps the OpenClaude-compatible readable stdin path as the default, disables early input capture, forces no-args startup to the classic REPL, clears inherited TUI handoff flags, and clears fragile stdin overrides unless `DUCKHIVE_ALLOW_FRAGILE_STDIN=1` is set; use `DUCKHIVE_USE_DATA_STDIN=1` only when you intentionally want to compare the alternate data-event input path. The `npm run smoke` gate now runs the Ink stdin delivery and `TextInput` prompt-rendering tests before launching the CLI smoke cases, so default REPL typing coverage is part of the normal release check instead of a separate manual test. On Windows without Go or `tui\duckhive-tui.exe`, the doctor and `duckhive tui` both point at the missing Go prerequisite while leaving the classic REPL as the safe default. On non-macOS hosts, the computer-use check confirms that the bundled `newest-desktop-control` gateway is available for desktop, Android, and `computer_use_*` compatibility aliases instead of requiring Codex.app.

For installed CLI diagnostics, use `duckhive runtime-doctor` or `duckhive doctor-runtime`. `duckhive doctor:runtime` is also accepted as a compatibility alias for users copying the npm script naming style, and it runs the same terminal-safe checks without starting the REPL.

When the installed CLI is run without an attached terminal and without
`-p/--print`, DuckHive fails fast with guidance instead of waiting in a REPL that
cannot accept keyboard input. This protects PowerShell pipes, CI shells, and
Codex-style subprocess checks from looking like a frozen startup screen.

The Go TUI prompt and streaming markers use ASCII-safe `> ` and `|` indicators across the legacy and component input paths, avoiding mojibake in Windows terminals and plain log captures. Its standalone header now tracks the current DuckHive version and MiniMax M2.7 default model instead of stale OpenClaude/Claude-era labels. When `/tui` is run from the classic REPL, DuckHive now waits for the child TUI to survive a short startup window before exiting the parent REPL; if the TUI fails immediately, the classic REPL stays usable and reports that `duckhive tui` can be run directly for the full startup message.

Recent verification snapshot:

- `bun test`: `2415 pass`, `0 fail`
- `bun run build`, `bun run smoke`, `bun run verify:privacy`, and `bun run doctor:runtime`: passing
- `cd tui && go test ./...`: not run in this Windows checkout because Go is not installed; `duckhive tui` and `bun run doctor:runtime` both report the missing Go prerequisite and keep the classic REPL as the safe default
- `duckhive --version`: `0.11.0 (DuckHive)`
- `openclaude --version`: upstream OpenClaude remains separately owned when installed
- package dry-run publishes as `duckhive@0.11.0`, includes the `duckhive` launcher, `duckhive/sdk`, `duckhive/harness`, `config/`, and the runtime `skills/newest-desktop-control/` skill files without test fixtures

Known debt: `bun run typecheck` is still a repo-wide hardening task. The current pass has already added missing transport/OAuth/optional-integration type surfaces, but remaining errors are broad pre-existing TypeScript debt in dormant optional modules, legacy command surfaces, ACP/bridge paths, telemetry, and older UI/test typing. Runtime build, tests, SDK bundle checks, privacy verification, smoke, and doctor are the current green gates; TUI Go tests require Go to be installed.

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Yolo Mode (`--yolo` flag)
DuckHive supports yolo mode both as a startup CLI flag and as an in-app toggle:
```bash
# Start with yolo mode already enabled
duckhive --yolo

# Or inside duckhive REPL, type:
/yolo on   # enable
/yolo off  # disable
/yolo      # toggle
```

### OpenClaw Integration
DuckHive includes internal OpenClaw gateway helper operations in the Crestodian diagnostics layer:
- `openclaw-status` - Check OpenClaw gateway status
- `openclaw-restart` - Restart OpenClaw gateway

These are helper operations to manage OpenClaw, not top-level DuckHive slash commands. OpenClaw and DuckHive are separate:
- `openclaw` - OpenClaw gateway/agent (standalone)
- `duckhive` - DuckHive AI coding harness

### Timer in TUI
The Go TUI (`duckhive-tui`) now shows a live session elapsed clock in the header and status rail.
The bridge-backed API-duration aggregate is still a partial metric in this surface until the bridge forwards the same duration totals the legacy REPL already tracks.

### Terminal Freezes During Heavy Tasks
The SerialBatchEventUploader has a blocking queue. During heavy tool use,
the queue fills and `enqueue()` blocks the Node.js event loop.
Workarounds: split tasks, reduce concurrent calls, use `/yolo on`.

### Building from Source
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/DuckHive-git
bun run build
# Rebuilds dist/cli.mjs from TypeScript source
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: OpenClaw vs OpenClaude (2026-05-09)

DuckHive is based on **OpenClaude** (https://github.com/Gitlawb/openclaude), NOT OpenClaw.

| Project | URL | Role in DuckHive |
|---------|-----|------------------|
| **OpenClaude** | https://github.com/Gitlawb/openclaude | DIRECT UPSTREAM - DuckHive is forked from this |
| **OpenClaw** | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw | SEPARATE project - DuckHive can interact with it via built-in commands |
| **DuckHive** | https://github.com/Franzferdinan51/DuckHive | Ryan's fork with MiniMax/MMX/Agent Teams |

### Built-in OpenClaw Gateway Helpers
These internal helper operations let DuckHive check/manage the **OpenClaw gateway** running separately:
- `openclaw-status` - Check OpenClaw gateway status (must be running at localhost:18789)
- `openclaw-restart` - Restart OpenClaw gateway

These are helper operations to manage OpenClaw, not DuckHive slash commands and not DuckHive's upstream.

### Common Confusion
- Type `duckhive` → starts DuckHive (based on OpenClaude)
- Type `openclaw` → starts OpenClaw gateway (separate process)

They CAN run together - DuckHive uses OpenClaw commands as helpers, but they are completely separate programs.
